# Samizdat

Samizdat is part of a project to create static HTML from markdown files uploaded to GitHub.
Over time, more web hosting features have been added.
A sub-goal is to test open accounting, where figures can be presented continuously after being anonymized.

This integration handles invoicing independently and synchronizes invoices with Fortnox.
Minimal local customer data is stored in Fortnox.
Registered payments and supplier invoices are retrieved from Fortnox and displayed in the local customer interface.
It can be configured to display everything publicly as well.
