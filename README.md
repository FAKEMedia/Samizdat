# Samizdat
Documenting differences in media coverage of the war in Ukraine

In the former Eastern Bloc where free speach was prohibited people used other methods. The underground 
grassroot movement of manual reproduction and distribution of text was called samizdat.

As media no longer can report freely in Russia there are incredible differences in what is reported
by government controlled media and what the rest of the world can see. As foreign news sites sometimes 
are filtered this repository aims to provide tools to fetch some representative content and use it to 
create a disk image that can be downloaded as a torrent file.
